# Sort an Array

LeetCode Q # 912.

Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

Example 1:

> Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]</br>
> Output: [1,2,3,5]</br>
> Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

Example 2:

> Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]</br>
> Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]</br>
> Explanation: Note that the values of nums are not necessairly unique.
